Understand Your Goal: The objective of this project is to build a domain-specific language (DSL) and simulation platform for derivatives pricing — focusing initially on options. You will be creating a compiler toolchain using MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) that can parse, lower, optimize, and run custom operations related to quantitative finance. Instead of using a generic programming language like Python or C++, you are defining a financial modeling language from scratch. This lets you control how each part of your derivative simulation — from asset paths to payoff calculations — is compiled and optimized. It's like building a mini MATLAB for quants.

What Is MLIR?: MLIR is a compiler infrastructure that makes it easier to build new programming languages and optimize them. Think of it like LEGO blocks that let you create your own toy language — except your toy can perform complex computations like financial simulations. MLIR works by letting you define "dialects" (your own instructions), then gradually transforming them into lower-level operations that can eventually be executed on CPUs or GPUs. For this project, MLIR allows you to define pricing models as high-level operations (like simulate_gbm or price_option) and translate those to efficient, low-level executable code.

What Is LLVM?: LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies that are widely used in industry and academia. Languages like Rust, Swift, Julia, and even parts of Python rely on LLVM to produce fast executable code. In your project, you’ll use MLIR (a subproject of LLVM) to build your custom language and then convert that to LLVM Intermediate Representation (LLVM IR). LLVM IR is very close to machine code, and once your pricing model is translated into this, it can be compiled into lightning-fast binaries. This project leverages LLVM to combine finance, compilers, and performance.

Why MLIR for Quant?: Financial models, especially those used in quantitative analysis, often involve lots of matrix operations, stochastic processes, and simulations. MLIR allows you to design your own modeling syntax that is closer to financial theory, yet can be compiled down to very efficient machine code. Instead of relying on generic libraries, you get full control over how your pricing logic is represented and optimized. This makes it not only faster but also more flexible, as you can build abstractions that are domain-specific and expressive. MLIR bridges the gap between mathematical expressiveness and low-level performance optimization.

Set Your Project Theme: You need a conceptual and functional name to anchor your project — let's say it's called "DerivLab" (short for Derivatives Laboratory). This gives your project a distinct identity and frames it as an experimental, extensible toolkit for pricing financial derivatives. Think of it as a sandbox where you can build, test, and refine various derivative pricing models, experiment with stochastic processes, and compile them into highly efficient code. The name should appear in your file paths, dialect names, and documentation. A consistent project theme helps you stay organized and communicate your work effectively.

Pick the Right Editor: Use a modern, flexible text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C++, CMake, and terminal access. Visual Studio Code is widely used and supports extensions for syntax highlighting and terminal integration. If you’re using Windsurf, make sure it can handle folders, has multi-pane support, and integrates with Git. This project involves editing many files across different folders (e.g., headers, source code, build scripts, test files). You'll frequently run commands in the terminal to build your project or run simulations. Your editor should make this seamless.

Clone LLVM Repository: Start by downloading the full LLVM project from GitHub, which includes MLIR as a subdirectory. Use the command git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git in your terminal. This command downloads the entire LLVM source code — it’s large, so be patient. You’ll use the MLIR part of this repository to build your own dialect for financial modeling. Cloning the repo gives you access to all the infrastructure, tools, and samples you’ll need. It also lets you compile everything from source, which is necessary to plug in your own dialects and passes.

Create a Build Directory: After cloning the repository, create a separate build directory inside the llvm-project folder using mkdir build. This keeps all the compiled files, object files, and executables separate from the source code. This practice is called an "out-of-source build" and is widely recommended because it makes it easier to clean or rebuild parts of the project without affecting the original source files. All your build commands and compilation steps will take place in this directory. It also helps prevent confusion between source and compiled files.

Install CMake and Ninja: These are essential tools for building large C++ projects like LLVM. CMake is a configuration tool that generates build scripts for compilers. Ninja is a fast build system that executes the actual compilation. You can install them via your system's package manager or from official websites. Once installed, confirm they’re available on your terminal by running cmake --version and ninja --version. Without these tools, you won’t be able to compile LLVM or your MLIR dialect. Think of them as the foundation that translates your setup into actual binaries.

Run CMake Setup: Inside your build directory, you need to run CMake to configure the build system. Use a command like: cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release. This tells CMake to generate a Ninja-based build script, enables MLIR as the main subproject, and sets the build type to optimized. CMake will now scan all files, set up include paths, link dependencies, and get everything ready for compilation. If successful, it will produce build files that Ninja can understand. This step sets the groundwork for building MLIR and your custom dialect.

Build MLIR: After the setup, you need to actually build the MLIR components. Go to your build folder in the terminal and type ninja. This command invokes Ninja to begin the build process based on the setup created by CMake. It might take a while depending on your computer, since LLVM is a large system with many files to compile. At the end of this step, you will have compiled binaries and libraries for MLIR, which you’ll later extend. If the build completes successfully without errors, it means MLIR is now integrated and ready for customization.

Explore MLIR Examples Folder: Navigate to the mlir/examples directory in the LLVM repository. This folder contains simple example projects and dialects that demonstrate how MLIR works. Studying these will give you a good understanding of how to structure your own dialect. You’ll see things like toy language examples, standard operation transformations, and custom dialects. Try running and reading through the files in one of these examples. This is your learning playground — you can adapt the structure and components for your DerivLab project, ensuring you follow best practices.

Create DerivLab Folder: Inside the mlir/examples directory, create a new folder named DerivLab. This folder will store your entire custom dialect project, including headers, source files, test cases, and build instructions. Think of this like setting up the home for your new language. Organizing your project properly is crucial in large codebases like LLVM. This folder becomes your sandbox where everything related to your financial modeling DSL will reside. Naming it clearly helps other developers or reviewers understand its purpose and contents at a glance.

Add include Folder: Inside your DerivLab folder, create an include/DerivLab directory. This is where your C++ header files will go. In C++ projects, headers declare structures, functions, and types that other parts of your program can use. MLIR expects dialects to be split into header and implementation files, so setting this up from the beginning makes everything easier. These header files will eventually declare your custom operations, dialect classes, and interfaces that describe your financial simulation primitives like simulate_gbm, discount, and payoff_call.

Add lib Folder: Now create a lib/Dialect directory inside your DerivLab folder. This will contain your C++ implementation code for the dialect and its operations. While include holds the interface and declarations, the lib folder holds the actual code that makes things work. This is where you’ll implement the behavior of your custom MLIR operations, define lowering passes, and hook them into the compiler pipeline. Keeping this separate from headers follows good software engineering practices and aligns with how MLIR and LLVM projects are generally structured.

Add test Folder: To validate your dialect and operations, create a test directory inside the DerivLab folder. This will contain .mlir test files that use your custom syntax. These files help you manually or automatically check that your operations behave as expected and are correctly parsed and lowered. MLIR has built-in testing tools that will read these files and run checks. A strong set of tests ensures your dialect remains robust and reliable as it evolves and grows.

Add CMakeLists.txt: Inside the DerivLab folder, create a file named CMakeLists.txt. This file tells CMake how to compile your dialect code. You’ll use it to specify your source files, include paths, dependencies, and linkages to MLIR libraries. It essentially acts like a recipe for how to build your dialect. Every MLIR dialect or tool needs this configuration file. Writing it correctly ensures that your dialect is discovered and compiled during the main LLVM build process. You’ll later also modify the top-level CMake files to register this new dialect with the rest of MLIR.

Define DerivLabOps.td: Inside a folder like include/DerivLab, create a TableGen file named DerivLabOps.td. This file describes the custom operations in your dialect, like simulate_gbm, payoff_call, discount, etc. TableGen is a domain-specific language used by LLVM to auto-generate repetitive boilerplate C++ code. It’s powerful because it lets you define operations and their types declaratively, and MLIR generates parsing, printing, and verification logic for you. Think of this as designing your language’s vocabulary — each operation here becomes a building block of your financial modeling DSL.

Write simulate_gbm Operation: In DerivLabOps.td, define an operation called simulate_gbm that simulates Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). This operation will take inputs like spot price, volatility, interest rate, time to expiry, and number of steps or paths. It will return an array or tensor of simulated paths. Even though the computation won’t be defined here, this declaration tells MLIR what the operation looks like and what data types it uses. You’ll later implement the actual simulation logic in a lowering pass or runtime backend. This is a key operation for any option pricing model.

Use TableGen Syntax: When writing DerivLabOps.td, you’ll use a special syntax provided by TableGen to define types, inputs, outputs, and documentation. It may look intimidating at first, but once you get the pattern, it becomes a time-saver. TableGen automatically generates C++ classes and helper functions for each operation, reducing boilerplate. You’ll specify things like operand types (f64), result types, operation name, and traits (e.g., whether it has side effects). Think of this as building blueprints — you define the shape of your commands, and MLIR builds the code that can recognize and process them.

Create DerivLabDialect.h: This header file will declare your new dialect and link it to the TableGen definitions. It acts like an entry point for all operations in your dialect. Inside this file, you’ll include the generated ops headers and define a class that inherits from mlir::Dialect. You will override the initialize() method to register all your custom operations (like simulate_gbm). This file ensures that MLIR can recognize your dialect name, parse your custom syntax, and prepare to apply lowering or transformation passes. It’s like giving MLIR a dictionary of your new language.

Create DerivLabDialect.cpp: This file provides the actual implementation of the dialect class declared in your header. Here you define how MLIR should handle your dialect — how it registers operations, types, and interfaces. You’ll include headers generated by TableGen, set up dialect initialization logic, and plug your dialect into the MLIR framework. This file connects the dots between your TableGen declarations and the MLIR engine. After this, MLIR will be able to parse and print your operations and include them in optimization pipelines. Think of it as teaching MLIR how to speak your new dialect fluently.

Link CMake to Your Dialect: To build your dialect, you need to edit the CMakeLists.txt in the examples/ directory to include DerivLab. You’ll list your new directories under add_subdirectory() and add your source files to the build. Without this, your dialect files won’t be compiled or recognized. Make sure to link against the right MLIR libraries like MLIRIR, MLIRPass, and MLIRTransforms. This step formally adds your dialect to the LLVM build system, so it compiles every time you run ninja. It’s like registering your dialect in the project’s master checklist.

Re-run Ninja: Now that you’ve set up your dialect files and updated the build configuration, go back to the build folder and run ninja again. This time, Ninja will compile not only MLIR but also your new DerivLab dialect. If everything is configured correctly, you should see your custom source files being compiled, and MLIR should now include your dialect during runtime. If there are errors, Ninja will print them, helping you debug syntax or linkage issues. A successful build here confirms your dialect is correctly integrated into the MLIR ecosystem.

Write a Test File: Create a new .mlir file inside your DerivLab/test folder. This file will use the syntax of your custom dialect — for example, you might write a line like simulate_gbm(%spot, %vol, %rate, %time) : (f64, f64, f64, f64) -> tensor<10xf64>. This test is your first real usage of the dialect you’ve defined. It helps you check if MLIR can parse your operations, verify types, and generate the correct intermediate representation. Keep the test small and focused on one operation at a time.

Use MLIR Syntax: MLIR syntax is like a mix of assembly and high-level functional code. For example, your file might define a function, take inputs, and call your custom ops inside. You write things like %out = derivlab.simulate_gbm(%in1, %in2) : (f64, f64) -> tensor<10xf64>. This syntax is flexible but can look strange at first. MLIR verifies types at every stage, so you need to match inputs and outputs precisely. Think of this test file as a simple script written in your new language — it tests whether the dialect is functioning as intended.

Run mlir-opt: Once your test file is ready, you’ll use the mlir-opt tool (included in your build) to check that your dialect is working. Run mlir-opt test.mlir -o output.mlir to process the file. If everything works, it will produce an output .mlir file with any optimizations or transformations applied. If there are errors (e.g., unknown operations, type mismatches), mlir-opt will print them. This is your way to simulate how MLIR parses and processes your new language. It confirms that your dialect is valid and ready to be extended with more logic.

No Code Generation Yet: At this point, your dialect is just syntactic. It parses and verifies inputs but doesn’t actually compute anything. That’s expected. You haven’t told MLIR how to lower your operations to real math yet. Think of this stage like writing grammar rules for a new language without teaching it what the words actually do. You’ll now focus on defining lowering passes — these are instructions to convert your high-level ops into lower, executable logic. This sets the stage for making your DSL computational.

Plan Your Commands: Now that the skeleton is working, list out the commands (operations) you’ll want in your dialect. For a derivatives lab, these might include simulate_gbm, payoff_call, payoff_put, discount, price_option, and avg_paths. Each command should reflect a building block of the option pricing process. You’ll define their inputs/outputs in TableGen, implement their logic in C++, and wire them into the MLIR pipeline. This plan is your dialect’s specification — like designing opcodes for a virtual machine. Start simple and expand later. Clear command definitions make your system robust and extensible.

Simulate GBM Paths: Next, implement a basic GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion) simulation behind your simulate_gbm operation. In reality, this means writing a lowering pass or runtime function that generates asset price paths using formulas like S(t+1) = S(t) * exp((r - 0.5 * vol^2) * dt + vol * sqrt(dt) * Z) where Z is a random draw from a standard normal distribution. Initially, hardcode or stub out randomness. Later, integrate real random generation. This operation is the foundation for Monte Carlo pricing, so focus on correctness and simplicity first. Eventually, you’ll simulate hundreds or thousands of such paths.

Define Types Clearly: Within your dialect, you should be explicit about the types of data you’re working with. Most operations in financial simulations use 64-bit floating point (f64) values or tensors of those. You’ll define these in your operation declarations in TableGen. Keeping consistent types avoids mismatches later during lowering and optimization. For arrays of paths or vectors, use tensor<Nxf64> notation in MLIR. Also, when declaring your operations, annotate them with traits that help MLIR optimize and understand them better, such as NoSideEffect or SameOperandsAndResultType. Clear type annotations make your dialect predictable and easier to lower.

Lower to Standard Dialect: Lowering is the process of translating your custom DerivLab operations into MLIR’s built-in operations from the Standard dialect. This is your next big step. For example, simulate_gbm might be lowered into a loop with math operations (addf, mulf, exp, etc.). You’ll write C++ lowering code that pattern-matches your DerivLab ops and replaces them with these basic building blocks. MLIR’s RewritePattern infrastructure helps with this. Think of this like translating human sentences into robot instructions. Lowering your operations properly ensures they can later be translated into LLVM IR and compiled to machine code.

Write Lowering Passes: To perform this translation (lowering), you need to implement custom rewrite patterns in C++. These patterns are part of MLIR’s pass infrastructure. For example, for the simulate_gbm operation, you write a function that identifies it in a function body, extracts its operands, and replaces it with loops and math that simulate asset price paths. This C++ function becomes part of a “lowering pass” that’s run over the whole program. Lowering passes are like translation tools that simplify high-level operations into primitive ones. You’ll use MLIR’s PatternRewriter class and populate your pass with rewrite rules.

Create a Pass Folder: Inside your lib/ directory, make a folder named Transforms or Lowerings. This folder will contain your lowering passes — C++ source files that implement the actual logic for converting DerivLab operations into standard MLIR or LLVM dialects. Keeping them in a dedicated folder helps maintain organization, especially as your project grows. In this folder, you'll define and register new transformation passes using MLIR’s PassRegistration system. Each file might correspond to a different transformation — one for lowering to standard dialect, another to LLVM dialect, and so on. Think of this folder as the compiler’s brain.

Write simulate_gbm Lowering: Inside your new Transforms folder, create a C++ file for lowering simulate_gbm. In this file, use MLIR’s PatternRewriter to detect the simulate operation and replace it with a loop that computes GBM paths using math ops like mulf, exp, addf, and constants. You may start with a loop over a fixed number of steps and hardcoded values. The goal is to show that your operation can be broken into basic computations. Once this works, you can add support for dynamic input (e.g., number of paths). This is where your finance model becomes real computation.

Connect Lowering to Dialect: Once your rewrite logic is ready, you must connect it to the rest of the MLIR pipeline. Register your lowering pass in the pass manager, so when MLIR runs optimization or code generation, it applies your transformations. This involves editing a central registry file or using MLIR’s pass registration macros. You also ensure that the pass is available as a command-line flag so it can be triggered manually using mlir-opt. Without this connection, your lowering logic won’t be used, and your operations won’t convert to executable form. This integration step makes your dialect executable.

Add Pass to Build System: Open your dialect’s CMakeLists.txt and add your new pass file to the build. Use add_mlir_dialect_library or add_mlir_library commands, depending on where the pass is defined. Make sure to link it against necessary MLIR libraries like MLIRIR, MLIRTransforms, and MLIRDialect. Without this step, your newly written lowering code won’t be compiled into your project, and MLIR tools won’t know it exists. This is like telling the compiler, “Hey, don’t forget this new logic I wrote.” Once added, rebuild using ninja to compile everything with the new pass included.

Add Pass to mlir-opt: To actually run your lowering pass on .mlir files, integrate it with mlir-opt. Use MLIR’s pass pipeline syntax to allow your pass to be invoked via command line. For example, you could run mlir-opt --pass-pipeline='builtin.module(lower-derivlab)' test.mlir. You’ll register the pass under a recognizable name in your C++ code using PassRegistration. Once integrated, this lets you easily test lowering by just re-running the tool with a flag. It makes your development and debugging loop faster — modify the pass, recompile, re-run mlir-opt, and inspect the result.

Lower to LLVM Dialect: After your DerivLab ops are lowered to standard MLIR ops, the next step is to lower further into the LLVM dialect — MLIR’s built-in representation of low-level machine code constructs. MLIR provides passes to convert standard math, control flow, and memory ops into LLVM-style ops. Use MLIR’s built-in --convert-std-to-llvm pass for this. This step prepares your model for real execution. Lowering to LLVM IR is necessary before you can compile it with LLVM tools like llc or run it through JIT. This transition is what makes your financial model machine-executable.

Run mlir-translate: MLIR provides a tool called mlir-translate that lets you convert .mlir files into LLVM IR once they’ve been lowered. Run a command like mlir-translate --mlir-to-llvmir test.mlir > output.ll after your pass and standard-to-LLVM conversions are complete. This produces .ll files — human-readable versions of LLVM IR — that represent your program in a form close to machine code. You can now inspect, optimize further, or compile these files using standard LLVM tools. This is a major milestone: your custom language has now produced real compiler-grade intermediate code.

Run llc to Compile LLVM IR: After converting your MLIR file to LLVM IR (output.ll), the next step is to use llc, LLVM’s static compiler, to translate that IR into an object file (.o). This file represents low-level machine code for your platform. Run llc output.ll -filetype=obj -o output.o. This step effectively compiles your custom DerivLab model into raw machine instructions. It’s a huge step forward — you’ve gone from high-level financial modeling to literal bytes the computer will execute. This object file is ready to be linked with libraries or wrapped into an executable.

Link Object File with Clang: Now take the .o file produced by llc and compile it into an actual executable using clang. You might run a command like clang output.o -o derivlab_exec. Clang will resolve symbols, link against standard libraries, and create a runnable binary. If your MLIR code called external functions like printf, you may need to add -lm or link extra math libraries. This final binary is the product of your entire MLIR toolchain. You can now run it and expect it to perform a GBM simulation or compute an option price — from your own custom language.

Run the Executable: After linking with Clang, you now have a real, runnable binary — maybe named derivlab_exec. Run it from the command line: ./derivlab_exec. If your program includes printf or logging functionality, it will output results directly. If not, you’ll want to modify your MLIR or runtime C++ to produce output. This is a great moment: you’ve defined a language, built its compiler, generated executable code, and now you're seeing it run. It’s like writing a little brain and watching it think. Validate your result by comparing with expected values from a known model.

Refine GBM Simulation: The initial simulate_gbm function might use a fixed number of paths or time steps. Now expand it. Add support for dynamic input — let users specify n_paths or dt. You’ll need to modify your operation definition in TableGen to accept these new operands, update your C++ lowering logic to loop accordingly, and verify the inputs. This makes your language more powerful and flexible, letting you run realistic simulations. Eventually, you'll want your operation to simulate thousands of paths and take vectorized input, like tensors of asset prices. This step pushes your pricing engine toward production-grade accuracy.

Add payoff_call Operation: After simulating asset prices, you need to compute the payoff from a European call option. This is max(0, S - K) where S is the final price and K is the strike. Create a new operation called payoff_call. Define it in TableGen with two operands: asset price and strike. Implement the logic as an element-wise comparison and subtraction using MLIR standard ops. You can start by lowering it to subf and maxf ops. Add a C++ lowering pass and test the output. This modular approach lets you reuse payoff_call later in different pricing strategies.

Add discount Operation: To get the present value of future payoffs, you’ll apply discounting using the formula exp(-r * T). Create a new operation discount that takes a float payoff, risk-free rate, and time-to-expiry. Lower it to standard math operations: multiply rate and time, negate, and exponentiate. You can use MLIR’s mulf, negf, and exp to do this. This operation turns future cash flows into their current value — an essential step in option pricing. By modularizing it, you can apply it anywhere — whether for call, put, or exotic options. Like payoff_call, this operation can be tested individually.

Chain simulate, payoff, and discount: Now build a full pipeline by chaining your three operations: simulate_gbm -> payoff_call -> discount. Write a .mlir file that calls each operation in sequence. For example: simulate a GBM path, apply payoff logic to each price, then discount each result. You may need to implement some kind of loop or tensor map to apply logic across many paths. Keep testing each stage with known values. The final output will be the estimated present value of the option — the full Monte Carlo pricing path. This validates your custom DSL can express full financial models.

Test Full MLIR Function: Write a full MLIR function in your dialect that simulates a call option pricing flow. Use meaningful variable names and annotate input/output types clearly. The function should accept inputs like spot, volatility, rate, strike, and expiry, then internally use your DerivLab ops to produce a price. Run it through your lowering pipeline and verify that the final output makes sense. You’re now turning input financial parameters into executable pricing logic. This function will be the centerpiece of your demos and benchmarks — a full pricing engine expressed in your own custom language.

Start README Documentation: Open a new README.md file in your GitHub project and explain DerivLab in plain language. Include what it is (a custom DSL for pricing derivatives), what it uses (LLVM + MLIR), and what operations it supports (simulate_gbm, payoff_call, discount). Show a short code snippet in .mlir syntax that demonstrates a simple pricing computation. Document how to build and run the project. Your README is your project's storefront — it should be readable even by people who don’t know MLIR. Clear documentation helps others understand and builds credibility when you showcase this to future employers or professors.

Organize Your GitHub Repository: Create a clean folder structure in your GitHub repo. Have docs/ for documentation, mlir/ for your dialect source files, tests/ for MLIR test files, and scripts/ for build or demo scripts. Include a top-level CMakeLists.txt and update it regularly. Push regularly to GitHub with meaningful commit messages. Include a .gitignore to avoid cluttering your repo with build artifacts. If possible, add GitHub topics like llvm, mlir, quant-finance, and dsl. This makes your repo easier to discover. A well-structured and documented repo makes your project look polished and professional — just like your custom compiler deserves.

Visualize Execution Flow: It helps to draw a diagram showing how the MLIR passes transform your .mlir file step by step — from DerivLab ops, to standard ops, to LLVM IR, to machine code. You can use tools like draw.io or Excalidraw to sketch this out. A visual overview helps you and others understand where your dialect fits in the compilation pipeline. Include this diagram in your README or a dedicated docs/ section. This step isn't mandatory for functionality, but it adds clarity and boosts the appeal of your repo when sharing or presenting your project.

Write Example MLIR Files: To help users and reviewers, include .mlir test files that show real usage. For example, write call_option_example.mlir that simulates a GBM path, computes the call payoff, and applies discounting. Add another file for a put option later. These example scripts serve as unit tests and documentation. When someone wants to see what your language does, they’ll look at these first. It also helps you test changes quickly — just re-run mlir-opt on the file after edits. These become your “hello world” examples that explain everything your dialect can currently support.

Benchmark Performance: Use tools like time or more advanced profilers to measure how fast your executable runs. Compare your results against a Python implementation of the same logic — maybe using NumPy for GBM simulation. The goal isn’t just to be faster, but to show how MLIR’s pipeline gives you a predictable and tunable optimization flow. Record your execution times for different numbers of simulated paths (e.g., 1,000, 10,000, 100,000). Then visualize the scaling with a small graph. These benchmarks will be useful in your report, GitHub wiki, or when pitching the project in interviews or demos.

Add Black-Scholes Comparison: To validate your Monte Carlo pricing model, implement the analytical Black-Scholes formula for European options. Either include it in your C++ runtime or via a Python script for comparison. This helps you ensure your GBM-based pricing aligns with theoretical values. Run both models with identical inputs (spot, volatility, rate, strike, expiry) and compare outputs. Include results in your documentation. This adds credibility to your implementation, shows awareness of theoretical finance, and is especially useful if presenting to a quant audience or in an academic setting.

Create a License and Contributing Guide: Add an open-source license like MIT or Apache-2.0 to your GitHub repository to clarify usage rights. Include a LICENSE file at the root. Also create a CONTRIBUTING.md file explaining how others can contribute to your dialect — how to fork, build, test, and submit pull requests. Mention expected code formatting and comment standards. These files make your project more professional and contributor-friendly. Even if you’re working solo now, they demonstrate long-term thinking and open-source etiquette, which reflects well in interviews and academic submissions.

Automate Build with Makefile or Script: Create a Makefile or a simple shell script (build.sh) that automates the full setup: building MLIR, compiling DerivLab, running tests, and optionally converting to LLVM IR. Include helpful aliases like make test, make clean, or make run. This ensures reproducibility — others (or your future self) can set up the project with a single command. Automation also makes continuous integration easier down the line. Add comments in the script for clarity. Keep it simple and cross-platform if possible. This makes the project more approachable and production-ready.

Set Up GitHub Actions for CI: Use GitHub Actions to run automated builds and test runs whenever you push changes or open a pull request. In .github/workflows/ci.yml, define jobs for checking build integrity (ninja) and running example .mlir tests through mlir-opt. This gives you early warnings for regressions or syntax issues. Add test scripts that check whether lowered output matches expectations. CI also proves to recruiters or professors that your code is stable and regularly tested. It’s one of the best low-effort, high-visibility improvements you can make.

Write a Two-Page Project Summary: Summarize DerivLab in a formal PDF — use LaTeX or Markdown to PDF tools. Include an overview, methodology, architecture diagram, example syntax, performance comparison, and future work. You can use this document in academic conferences, classroom presentations, or even job applications. It should feel like a mini whitepaper or thesis summary. Focus on clarity, not jargon. Use bullet points, visuals, and clean sections. This summary is like an elevator pitch on paper, and often more useful than a README alone.

Support Exporting Simulation Results: Modify your runtime logic or dialect lowering to optionally print or export simulation results to a .csv or .json file. This is useful if you want to visualize results in Python, Excel, or online tools like ObservableHQ. Format the output clearly — each row could be one GBM path, or include headers like path_id, timestep, price. This makes DerivLab usable in data workflows and strengthens its claim as a “lab” for simulation experimentation. It also gives quant users a familiar format to work with.

Engage with MLIR/LLVM Community: Once the project is stable, post about it on MLIR Discourse, LLVM mailing lists, or GitHub Discussions. Share what DerivLab is, what it supports, and how people can try it. Mention any feedback or collaborations you’re looking for. This step opens doors to expert review, potential contributors, and new features. You don’t need to be famous or perfect — the MLIR community is active and very supportive of niche dialects. If you’re planning to submit this project anywhere formally, community feedback can significantly improve the quality.

Follow a Clean Project Structure: Organize your project files to reduce confusion and ensure maintainability. Place dialect-related code under mlir/, tests in test/, documentation in docs/, and helper scripts in scripts/. This clear layout prevents accidental misplacements and makes the project accessible for new contributors. Use consistent naming conventions and avoid redundant folders. Keep build artifacts (e.g., object files, binaries) outside the main tree — ideally in a /build folder ignored via .gitignore. A well-structured project improves onboarding, debugging, and overall development velocity, especially as your dialect or its features expand.

Write Descriptive Variable and Operation Names: Use clear, self-explanatory names for MLIR operations, C++ variables, and test cases. For example, prefer simulate_gbm over sim_gbm or sgbm, and use risk_free_rate instead of r. Clarity trumps brevity in compiler development. Avoid cryptic abbreviations unless they are industry standard. This makes the code easier to debug, extend, and explain. Consistent naming also helps during passes, where matching strings must align. For every new developer (or your future self), these names will make the difference between an hour and a day of debugging.

Use Assertions and Logging Early: In your dialect logic and runtime implementation, use assert() or MLIR error handlers to catch invalid inputs and assumptions. For example, assert that volatilities are positive or expiry is non-zero. Add logs in lowering passes to print transformation stages. Use llvm::errs() or structured logging where appropriate. This debugging scaffolding can be stripped later, but in the beginning, it saves immense time. Without it, diagnosing silent bugs in code generation or simulation logic becomes tedious. Make the code fail loud, early, and clearly when something breaks.

Adopt a Consistent Commenting Style: Use uniform, concise comments to explain what each function or operation does, especially in C++ files. Document every pass with a short header describing its purpose. In .td files, comment above each operation about its function (e.g., // simulate_gbm: simulates Geometric Brownian Motion paths). In MLIR test files, add inline comments to show expected behaviors. If someone reads your code top-down, they should never wonder “why” — comments answer that question. Good comments paired with clean naming create self-documenting code, which is vital in compiler pipelines.

Use clang-format to Enforce Style: Set up clang-format with a .clang-format file to maintain consistent indentation, spacing, and bracing across all C++ code. This prevents diff noise and style inconsistencies in version control. Integrate it into your editor (e.g., VS Code or Windsurf) or run it automatically in GitHub Actions. This keeps your codebase visually uniform and easier to review. Style is subjective, but consistency is not — and automated formatting eliminates that problem entirely. It also shows professionalism when submitting the project for evaluation.

Avoid Deep Nesting and Long Functions: Break large functions into smaller helpers. In MLIR passes, avoid functions that do everything — instead separate pattern matching, type checking, and IR generation. This modularity makes each component easier to test and reuse. Similarly, try to keep .td files readable by avoiding complex traits or ops that do too much. Clean structure reduces mental load and avoids hidden bugs in one long function body. If a function scrolls off your screen, it probably needs refactoring. This practice will save debugging time and encourage better design thinking.

Write Unit Tests for Each Operation: For every custom operation you define (like simulate_gbm, payoff_call, or discount), write a corresponding .mlir file that isolates and tests just that operation. These unit tests ensure that each operation parses, verifies, and lowers correctly. For example, test simulate_gbm with valid and invalid parameters. Place these tests in the test/ directory and name them clearly (e.g., test_simulate_gbm.mlir). Run them through mlir-opt and check for expected output or error messages. Unit tests form the foundation of stable development and help catch regressions early.

Use FileCheck for Output Validation: Leverage LLVM’s FileCheck tool to verify that the transformation or lowering of your .mlir files produces the expected intermediate representation. Add // CHECK: comments in test files to assert the presence of specific operations or patterns after a pass runs. This allows precise testing of transformation logic and guarantees that compiler passes behave as intended. FileCheck is integrated with LLVM’s testing infrastructure and is powerful for automation. Use it extensively for both dialect verification and IR lowering tests. It replaces fragile print-debugging with assertive, scriptable testing.

Test the Full Compilation Pipeline: Write integration tests that take a .mlir file through the entire process — from DerivLab ops to final LLVM IR or executable output. Create test scripts that use mlir-opt, mlir-translate, llc, and clang in sequence. Feed in a small input (e.g., one option price calculation), compile it, run it, and assert that the numeric output is within expected bounds. This validates the whole pipeline and confirms that all pieces — dialect, passes, and runtime — work in harmony. It is a strong indicator of system-level stability.

Use Regression Tests After Each Milestone: After implementing any major feature or pass, lock in its behavior with a regression test. These tests ensure that future edits don’t accidentally break previously working code. For example, after adding support for GBM step batching or payoff composition, save working .mlir samples and their outputs. Rerun them after new commits using CI or test scripts. Regression testing keeps the project reliable as it grows. It also gives you peace of mind to refactor code aggressively without fear of subtle breakages.

Create Fuzz Tests for Edge Cases: Write scripts that generate random inputs for DerivLab operations — negative volatility, zero expiry, extreme spot prices — and observe how your system behaves. It should either process them correctly or fail gracefully with informative errors. These “fuzz” tests expose edge cases and unexpected input combinations that might crash or mislead your logic. Run fuzz tests frequently to harden your code. They are especially useful before public releases or thesis submission, ensuring your dialect is robust, not just functional.

Include Human-Readable Golden Outputs: For each important .mlir file, generate and save the expected lowered or LLVM IR output in a golden/ folder. During tests, compare current output against these golden files to detect changes. This technique ensures traceability — if something breaks or changes unexpectedly, you’ll know immediately. It’s also great for documentation: others can open the golden file and see exactly what your dialect produces. Keeping golden files up-to-date is part of clean release hygiene, especially when showcasing the project to evaluators or recruiters.

Design a Clean MLIR Dialect: In the mlir/include/DerivLab/ and mlir/lib/Dialect/ folders, define a minimal set of operations using .td files for derivative-specific concepts (e.g., simulate_gbm, payoff_call, discount). Keep operation syntax concise, modular, and intuitive. Each op should encapsulate a clear concept in finance. Register your dialect properly with DerivLabDialect.cpp and keep naming conventions consistent. This ensures your dialect feels polished and avoids the typical pitfalls of hand-rolled IRs. A clean dialect is the foundation that makes passes and compilation predictable and elegant.

Implement Custom Compiler Passes: Write MLIR-to-Standard or MLIR-to-LLVM passes that lower DerivLab operations into mathematical equivalents. For example, transform simulate_gbm into loops and exponential math ops in LowerSimulateGBM.cpp. Use mlir::PatternRewrite to define each transformation. Organize passes under mlir/lib/Transforms/ and ensure each pass only handles one transformation. Register these passes in Passes.cpp and expose them via CLI flags. These passes demonstrate you understand IR rewriting, a key skill in compiler work at quant/HFT firms.

Validate Simulation Correctness (GBM): Manually compute expected outputs for a simple GBM path given known inputs (e.g., spot = 100, vol = 0.2, r = 0.05, dt = 1). Compare the output of simulate_gbm after lowering and execution against the expected result. Use assertions or numerical comparisons (e.g., within ±0.01) to test. Include both constant and randomized seeds in testing. Prove the model isn't just running — it’s giving the right answer. Simulation correctness is critical for quant credibility.

Compare Monte Carlo vs Analytical Pricing: Implement the Black-Scholes analytical pricing model in either C++ or Python. For a European call option, simulate the same pricing setup using your MLIR dialect’s Monte Carlo engine. Compare the outputs across various strikes, vols, and maturities. Track error margins between Monte Carlo averages and analytical prices. Visualize this in a chart or CSV summary in docs/. This comparison shows your pricing engine is not a black box — it's accurate and trustworthy.

Pipeline to Fast LLVM Execution: After lowering to the LLVM dialect, use mlir-translate to convert to .ll (LLVM IR), then use llc to compile to assembly and clang to produce a binary. Measure how long the full chain takes. Document the commands in a build script or Makefile. Highlight how your compiler optimizes custom DSL into native code, showcasing how your work bridges domain-specific language design and high-performance systems engineering — a key theme in HFT engineering.

Build a Structured GitHub Repo: Organize your GitHub repo as per modern OSS practices: a README.md, LICENSE, docs/, test/, mlir/, and scripts/ folder. Use README.md to walk through examples, build steps, and testing methodology. Maintain docs/ for architecture, financial theory, and operation descriptions. Keep code linted and commented. Tag releases like v0.1, v1.0. A clean, well-structured repo tells hiring teams you take engineering seriously, even in a research-oriented setting.

Benchmark and Record Performance: Run your pricing engine with different numbers of paths, expiries, and spot prices. Record execution time and memory usage. Use CSV or JSON to store results and plot trends using Python or gnuplot. Show how the simulation scales and how much faster it is after being compiled with MLIR and LLVM. Highlight runtime vs interpretive languages (e.g., Python) in performance graphs. Benchmarks demonstrate that your MLIR project isn't just novel — it's fast, which is exactly what HFT firms want.

Establish a Thorough Test Suite: In the test/ folder, create unit tests for each operation (simulate_gbm, payoff_call, etc.), integration tests for full pipelines, and regression tests after every major commit. Use FileCheck for MLIR correctness and CLI tools for numeric output validation. Automate testing with GitHub Actions. A robust test suite with edge cases and validation logs shows HFT recruiters that you write safe, production-minded systems — not just experimental ones.
