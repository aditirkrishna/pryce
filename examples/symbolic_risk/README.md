# Symbolic Risk Engine Example — DerivLab

This elite example demonstrates:
- Human-readable contract and risk logic in MLIR (symbolic DSL)
- Scenario grid, stress testing, and adjoint (autodiff) risk hooks
- Compilation to fast native code via MLIR/LLVM
- Real-world risk system features: Delta, Gamma, Vega, scenario P&L

---

## How it Works

1. **`risk_test.mlir`** — Symbolic contract and risk logic (digital option, risk hooks, scenarios)
2. **`run_pipeline.sh`** — Lowers, compiles, and runs scenario grid, producing `output.csv`
3. **`output.csv`** — Output of scenario grid (price, Delta, Gamma, Vega, shocked P&L, etc.)

---

## Run the Example

```bash
bash run_pipeline.sh
```

## Output

- Scenario grid results: in `output.csv`
- Includes shocked prices and risk metrics for each scenario

This example shows how to go from symbolic contract logic to a full scenario/risk grid in a single pipeline — a unique, elite feature for HFT/quant platforms.
